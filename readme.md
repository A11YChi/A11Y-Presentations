## Overview
There are several aspects to a presentation that can make them inaccessible to portions of the audience. What follows are observations and guidance to ensure that your presentation is as accessible and inclusive to as many participants as possible.

## Preparing Presentation Content
### Foreground/Background Colors
Presentations with a light background (ex. white) and dark foreground (ex. text) can be difficult to view by members of your audience. The white background can create a glare that is actually painful for some individuals.
##### Suggested Guidance
We suggest using a dark background color (ex. black, grey, blue) to host your light (ex. white, light grey) foreground content. The dark color creates an improved negative space for the lighter content.
