## Overview
There are several aspects to a presentation that can make them inaccessible to portions of the audience. What follows are observations and guidance to ensure that your presentation is as accessible and inclusive to as many participants as possible.

## Presenter Info
1. If you have not been asked yet, do you have a headshot and/or brief bio description (1-5 sentences) to share?
2. Before the presentation, what is your preferred pronouns to be identified on social media and event announcements? For example, "[Jane Doe] is an engineer at [company]. Jane uses she/her pronouns and just recently published her new book!" If you do not want to share, it is totally okay.

## Preparing Presentation Content
### Foreground/Background Colors
Presentations with a light background (ex. white) and dark foreground (ex. text) can be difficult to view by members of your audience. The white background can create a glare that is actually painful for some individuals.
##### Suggested Guidance
We suggest using a dark background color (ex. black, grey, blue) to host your light (ex. white, light grey) foreground content. The dark color creates an improved negative space for the lighter content.

### Color Contrast
Just as WCAG 2.0 guides us on color contrast for the web, these guidelines should also be considered for your slides (aren't slides really just big web pages?). 

WCAG 2.0 requires that the foreground and background colors have a 4.5:1 contrast ratio at Level AA and a 7:1 contrast ratio at Level AAA. You can use a [contrast checker tool](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/) to determine what the ratio is between any foreground and background color.

Presentations can suffer even more, unexpected contrast issues, as lighting is typically not controlled by the organizer.

#### Suggested Guidance

Ensure contrast between foreground and background colors meet and, preferrably well exceed WCAG 2.0 standards for color contrast. This will help when the projection system, monitor, screen or wall where your slides are being displayed on is less than adequate in presenting your slides in the best possible manner.

### Font Size
As most presentations are created using desktop or laptop monitors in relatively close proximity. When the same slide content is viewed in a laerger room, likely from a distance, this text is likely to be too small to be easily read.

#### Suggested Guidance

Try to use a font size that can easily be viewed, without strain, from 100 feet or more. The minimum font size should be about 24 points (if using PowerPoint or Keynote) or 32 pixels (if using HTML/CSS). Headers and subheaders can be much larger, between 40-60 points (if using PowerPoint or Keynote) or 53-80 pixels (if using HTML/CSS).

### Font Weight

The weight, or thickness of a typeface can drastically alter the ability to view the text on a slide from a distance.

#### Suggested Guidance

When possible, consider using a medium to thick-weight typeface, which can be more easily see and read from a distance.
